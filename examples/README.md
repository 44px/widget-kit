# Examples

Some real-world examples where widget-kit utilities should serve as a good foundation.

## Banner

A widget that is located inside page content, adapts to parent's width and controls iframe height (like Embedded Tweets, Share Buttons, Facebook Page).

## Popup

A small button on the edge of a screen that opens fullscreen popup (like UserEcho).

## Chat

Similar to popup but opens small window that overlaps only part of a page (like Intercom and many other chat widgets).
